<!-- TechStack -->

## :space_invader: Technologies

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  * Javascript superset that makes it actually safe (and kinda fun üòÅ) to use.
* [React.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  * Next is the Javascript/React framework that I chose for this project, since it's currently the one that interests me the most and fits my needs.
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/es/)
  * I used Express as my main Nodejs framework to build a really small API.
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
  * I chose to use a Component Library like Chakra UI because it allowed me to be more focused on my code, instead of styling. It increased my development time, and it's the one that I find more easy to customize if I need to.
  * Chakra needs [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to work 
* [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)
  * Since my portfolio has a Works and Posts section and I didn't wanted to reinvent the wheel, I used Sanity.io as my (headless) cms, to store and manage all my posts.

<!-- Getting Started -->

## Starting the project.

<!-- Prerequisites -->

### Prerequirements

This project uses either yarn or npm as dependency/package manager. You should have npm installed if you already have Node. If you choose to use yarn, run the next command to install it:

```bash
 npm i -g yarn
```

<!-- Run Locally -->

### :running: Running the project locally

Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:enzom-uy/portfolio.git
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd portfolio
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
# with yarn:
  yarn
# with npm:
  npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
# with yarn:
  yarn start
# with npm:

```

You'll need to declare some env variables if you actually want it to work.
